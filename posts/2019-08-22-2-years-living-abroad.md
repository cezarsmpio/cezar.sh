**TL;DR;** Amazing!

About 2 years ago, I was living in a different country, Brazil more precisely. I received a job offer to move to a different country, Germany in this case.

It was almost 3 months of interviewing process after I received the offer email, my wife and I started packing our stuff towards Berlin.

2 years ago we arrived in Berlin, after 24 hours traveling, with 4 bags and our life and hope there, in a new land.

It was our first time in Europe as well. We were very impressed with everything. The airport was so quieeeet, totally different from that noise we were used to.

## Excitement

We were so amazed by the city, I was going to start working only a few days later so we took advantage to start exploring the city.

Museums, parks, zoo, supermarkets (what a journey though!), everything we needed to do, we wanted to learn the city, people, everything.

Going to supermarkets was a fun history, imagine all products in German and you have no clue what that product is. Google Translate for the win, but it's nice that it's not only you lost there, I remember a lot of people doing the same haha. Fortunately, we are used to that nowadays and we know the products that we like and commonly consume. Sometimes we think something is sweat but it's not and vice-versa. Living and learning.

## Work

I started my job at HelloFresh a few days after we arrived in Berlin, I was so nervous. It would be the first time I'd speak and work in English full-time, I was shaking, my heart was desperate and I thought: what am I doing here?

English was and is a big deal for me, fortunately, I've had really good people around me who have helped in a lot of situations.

There are plenty of Portuguese speakers there, so this had helped me to feel more comfortable, it's very good you can feel at home, at least for some moments.

## Opportunities

Coming to a different country, especially in Europe, gave us a lot of different opportunities. In 2 years, we've been to Italy, England, Portugal, France, Germany, and Croatia. I think we would never have such an opportunity and we still have plans to go to different places.

It's such a unique experience when you can meet different cultures, places, know the history, you realize that our planet is tremendously huge, this also makes you learn more and more because it's very normal people here who speak more than 3 languages.

## Weather

Well, I need to admit that Berlin is way colder than Curitiba. My worst winter in Brazil was -1ºC.

My first winter in Berlin was -18ºC.

Looks like, OMG YOU ARE GONNA DIE! Well... It's still cold but fortunately, the city is well prepared, all places have heater systems, like cafes, trains, trams, work, home. So you don't feel it, of course, you feel it when you walk outside but nobody does it, I hope so.

The first thing I noticed here was how seasons are so visible, you can see nature changing all over the place. Trees are losing their leaves when the winter is coming, everything growing again in the spring,  it's fantastic and beautiful!

Another thing I needed to get used to was how sunlight changes drastically from seasons. While in the summer you have sunlight from 5 am to 11 pm, on the other hand, your days will be completely dark in the winter, be prepared for your day to end before 4 pm.

## Do I miss my country?

Yes, of course! I love my country, it's such a beautiful place, I miss my family, my friends, the food. I still want to go back and retribute I knowledge I have been learning so far.

## What next?

> Hi, it's me!

I'm here for 2 years and I haven't started learning German, so this is my next big goal for the next year. I have no idea how this is going to end up haha.

Are you going to follow me on my journey? ;)

Stay tuned, see you!
