**TL;DR;** Amazing!

About 2 years ago, I was living a different country, Brazil more precisely. I received a job offer to move to a different country, Germany in this case.

It was almost 3 months for the interviewing process, after we received the news I got approved, my wife and I started packing our stuff towards Berlin.

2 years ago we arrived at Tegel, after 24 hours travelling, with 4 bags and our live and hope there, in a new land.

It was our first time in Europe as well. We were very impressed with everything. The airport was so quieeeet, totally different from that noise we are used to.


## Excitement

We were so amazed by the city, I was going to start working only a few days later so we took advantage and started exploring the city.

Museums, parks, zoo, supermarkets (what a journey though!), everything we needed to do, we wanted to learn the city, people, everything.

Going to supermarkets is a fun history, imagine all products in German and you have no clue what that product is. Google Translate for the win, but it's nice that it's not only you lost on that, I remember a lot of people doing the same haha. Fortunately we are used to that nowadays and we know the products that we like and commonly consume.
